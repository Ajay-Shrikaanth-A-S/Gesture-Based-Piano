# Gesture-Based Piano
## Project Overview
The Gesture-Based Piano is an innovative project that uses hand gestures to play musical notes on a virtual piano. This project was developed using Arduino UNO, IR sensors, buzzers, and LEDs to detect hand movements and map them to specific piano keys. The goal of this project is to create an interactive musical experience that can be controlled without physical contact, making it ideal for users with disabilities or anyone looking for a unique way to play the piano.

## Project Features:
Gesture Recognition: Uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect hand movements and play corresponding piano notes.

Arduino UNO: The core of the system, processing sensor data and controlling the virtual piano.

Buzzers & LEDs: Provide audio feedback through buzzers and visual feedback through LEDs when a key is pressed.

Virtual Piano Interface: The piano keys are visualized on a screen, and the hand gestures trigger the respective notes.

Educational Purpose: Helps in teaching music through interactive and engaging methods.

Engagement with School Students: The project was demonstrated to school students, providing an educational and fun experience that integrates technology and music.

Judges' Feedback: The project received positive comments from the judges for its creativity, functionality, and educational value.

## About the Team:
The team consists of enthusiastic individuals passionate about combining technology with music. Together, we worked to develop an innovative solution to create a piano that can be played using simple hand gestures, removing the need for physical touch. Our mentor, Mr.Mahesh Kumar, guided us through the technical challenges and provided valuable insights that helped bring this project to life.

## How It Works
The Gesture-Based Piano works by detecting the movement of your hand using IR sensors. The sensors are positioned in a way that allows them to capture hand gestures and send the data to an Arduino UNO. The Arduino processes the data and maps each gesture to a corresponding piano note.

Gesture Detection: As the user moves their hand over the IR sensors, the system detects the changes in the sensor's readings.

Note Mapping: The movement is mapped to specific piano keys, each producing a different musical note.

Sound Generation: Once the gesture is recognized, the virtual piano interface triggers the appropriate note, and the sound is played through speakers or headphones.

Feedback Mechanism: Buzzers provide auditory feedback, and LEDs give visual feedback to indicate when a note has been played.

## Technology Used:
Arduino UNO: The central microcontroller used to read sensor inputs and trigger outputs.

IR Sensors: Used to detect hand movements.

Buzzers & LEDs: Provide feedback to the user when a note is played.

Wokwi Simulator: A platform to simulate the virtual piano and test the system before physical implementation.

Conclusion
The Gesture-Based Piano is a unique and interactive way to experience music through technology. By using simple hand gestures, users can play a piano without physically touching any keys, making it an innovative tool for music enthusiasts and educators. The project was demonstrated to school students, offering them an engaging and educational experience. The positive feedback from the judges highlighted the creativity and educational value of the project. We hope this project inspires others to explore the intersection of technology and art in creative ways.
